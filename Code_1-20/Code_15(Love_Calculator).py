# ðŸ’ª This is a difficult challenge! ðŸ’ª
# You are going to write a function called calculate_love_score() that tests the compatibility between two names.
# To work out the love score between two people:
# 1. Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
# 2. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
# 3. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number and print it out.
# e.g.
# name1 = "Angela Yu" name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# T occurs 0 times
# R occurs 1 time
# U occurs 2 times
# E occurs 2 times
# Total = 5
# L occurs 1 time
# O occurs 0 times
# V occurs 0 times
# E occurs 2 times
# Total = 3
# Love Score = 53

# in the below code, count function is used to count the number of alphabet in the give word
